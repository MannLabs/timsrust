# TimsRust

A crate to read Bruker TimsTof data.

## Installation

Add this crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
timsrust = "x.x.x"
```

## Usage

TimsRust is intended to be used as a library and not as a stand-alone application. An example of how to use it is found in e.g. [Sage](https://github.com/lazear/sage).

### Basics

Two primary data types are exposed through TimsRust:
* Spectra: A traditional representation that expresses intensitites in function of mz values for a given precursor.
* Frames: All recorded data from a single TIMS elution (i.e. at one specific retention_time).

### File formats

Two file formats are supported:
* Bruker .d folder containing:
    * analysis.tdf
    * analysis.tdf_bin
* Bruker .ms2 folder containing:
    * converter.ms2.bin
    * converter.MS2Spectra.ms2.parquet

## Python bindings

The [timsrust_pyo3](https://github.com/jspaezp/timsrust_pyo3) package is an example of how the performance of TimsRust can be utilized in Python
